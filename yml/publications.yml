      We propose a more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor decomposition methods.
      Our approach, leveraging the Six-axis and CP decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency,
      and reconstruction/localization quality.

       This dissertation introduces the Semantic-Enhanced Multimodal Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (SEEM-PAR) framework, designed to predict attributes
       under challenging image conditions such as occlusion and low illumination.

    description: >
        For low training cost but sufficient multi-modal represenstation space, we introduce the mluti-modal prompt learning. Specifically, we construct visual and text prompt which consist of learnable parameters, and it go though the fixed image and text encoders, respectively. To focus effectively on the relationship between different modalities, we introduce the XSA module to fuse the tokens.

    description: >
        In this paper, we propose a novel neural image compression algorithm that uses block-based adaptive resizing.
        The proposed method divides an image into several 2N x 2N blocks and encodes them by addressing two resizing modes.
        The mode selection is determined based on the rate-distortion cost.
